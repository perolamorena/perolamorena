  <h1> Welcome, everyone! </h1>
</p>

I'm PÃ©rola Morena, a passionate data analyst from Brazil with a degree in Education from the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro. Currently transitioning into the field of data analysis, I bring a blend of communication, organizational, and analytical thinking skills. My previous experience provides me with a competitive edge, enabling me to translate complex analyses into clear and accessible insights for diverse teams.

During my training in the TripleTen Data Analysis bootcamp, I acquired solid technical knowledge in essential industry tools, including Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, and scikit-learn. I have hands-on experience applying these tools to solve business challenges in areas like machine learning, customer segmentation, KPI analysis, data-driven decision-making, statistical testing, and economic analysis.

As a teacher, I developed the ability to explain concepts clearly and accessibly, a crucial skill for communicating data insights to varied audiences. My experience in planning and scheduling equips me to structure data projects efficiently, meet deadlines, and manage priorities effectively. My goal is to leverage my technical and interpersonal skills to transform data into strategic decisions, contributing to teams and organizations that value clarity, precision, and data-driven insights.

Fluent in English and with an intermediate level of Spanish, I am also prepared to collaborate on international projects.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m excited about the future of data analysis and eager to make a meaningful impact in this field!
