  <h1> Welcome, everyone! </h1>
</p>

**My name is PÃ©rola Morena, and I am a data analyst in transition. Itâ€™s a pleasure to have you here!** Iâ€™ve always been passionate about learning and communication, which initially led me to pursue a degree in **Education** at the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro. Recently, Iâ€™ve discovered my love for **data analysis** and decided to pivot my career into this dynamic field.

In September 2022, I embarked on a journey to deepen my skills in **Data Analysis** through specialized training. I graduated from the TripleTen **Data Analysis Bootcamp**, where I acquired strong technical expertise in Python and its key libraries, including **pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, and scikit-learn**, among others. During the bootcamp, I learned how to apply these tools to solve business problems, such as **machine learning, customer segmentation, KPI analysis, statistical testing, and economic analysis**. I also developed practical skills in **data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing**.

My experience as a teacher has equipped me with excellent communication and organizational skills, allowing me to explain complex data insights in a clear and accessible way. This, combined with my ability to manage schedules and priorities, ensures that I can execute data projects efficiently and effectively.

Additionally, I am fluent in **English** and have an **intermediate level of Spanish**, enabling me to work on international projects and collaborate with diverse teams. My goal is to use my technical and interpersonal skills to transform data into actionable insights that drive strategic decisions, contributing to organizations that value clarity and data-driven growth.

If you have any questions or would like to connect, **feel free to reach out**. Iâ€™m excited about the future of data analysis and eager to make a meaningful impact in this field!
