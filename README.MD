<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm PÃ©rola Morena</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate data analyst from Brazil, I hold a degree in Education from the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, and I am currently transitioning into the field of data analysis, bringing a combination of communication, organizational, and analytical thinking skills. I believe my previous experience gives me a competitive edge, enabling me to translate complex analyses into clear and accessible insights for diverse teams. Throughout my training in the TripleTen Data Analysis bootcamp, I gained solid technical knowledge in key industry tools, including Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, plotly, scipy, and scikit-learn. I have practical experience applying these tools to solve business problems in areas such as machine learning, customer segmentation, KPI analysis, data-driven decision-making, statistical testing, and economic analysis. As a teacher, I developed a unique ability to explain concepts clearly and accessibly, which is essential for communicating data insights to various audiences. My experience with planning and scheduling allows me to structure data projects efficiently, meeting deadlines and managing priorities. My goal is to apply my technical and interpersonal skills to transform data into strategic decisions, contributing to teams and organizations that value clarity, accuracy, and data-driven insights. I am also fluent in English and have an intermediate level of Spanish, which enables me to participate in international projects.</h3>
